# About me
Welcome to my website, [KatieThe.Dev](/)! Here you will find information about my homelab, some of my projects, and anything else I feel like posting on my [blog section](/posts).

If you have any ideas for any of my projects, something you would like me to cover, or anything else you would like to contact me about, please feel free to email me at {{< attr class="text-accent-color" >}}contact [@] katiethe.dev{{< /attr >}}! I use ProtonMail, so if you use it your messages are encrypted by default. Otherwise, you can choose to use PGP using the key posted on my About page!

# PGP
Any new PGP keys will be posted as signed by my previous key. If new keys are posted without a signature, it may indicate I was compromised in some way.
