# License FAQ
## Usage
### Can I reuse code or text from this project?

Yes, you may reuse any code or text on the website. It is released into the public domain under the unlicense.

### Can I use your logos or images?

No, any logos or images are exempt from the Unlicense and I retain copyright to them. For more information, please read the LICENSE.

### What about forking?

Under GitHub's terms of service, I am required to allow viewing and forking as this is a public repository. That said, further usage of any images would violate my copyright unless you purchase a license.

### Can I use this site/repository to train generative AI?

You cannot use images or other files exempted from the LICENSE for training AI. Text, code, and other writtn works may be used as they are public domain (unless specifically exempted). That said, I would prefer you do not. Generative AI steals from creators and has a host of other ethical and moral issues. Please reconsider using this project for AI purposes, especially as I cannot guarantee the accuracy of content published here.
