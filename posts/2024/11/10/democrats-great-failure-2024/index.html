We&rsquo;ve seen posts on Reddit asking for advice on getting people&rsquo;s illegal family members deported because someone voted for Trump. We see Democrats blaming any minority who speaks up. The Democratic party has failed the working class yet again, and is allowing hate to run rampant.</p><p>While the election isn&rsquo;t 100% done being counted as of yet, current AP numbers at the time of writing show Trump won the election with 312 electoral votes. He won over 74.7 million votes and Harris got nearly 71 million votes. Both numbers are significantly lower than 2020. But how did this happen?</p><h1 id=the-rise-of-the-grifters>The rise of the grifters<a href=#the-rise-of-the-grifters class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>Since 2020, and alongside COVID, we saw the rise of popularity of far-right grifters online. This includes classics such as Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk, as well as newer faces such as Andrew Tate. With the rise of these fascist grifters, Gen Z boys and men have increasingly become further right. I believe this is much of the cause for the landslide Trump win.</p><p>In <a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1417619/gb-men-opinion-andrew-tate-by-age/>a study</a>, British men were asked their opinion of Andrew Tate. The group with the most favorable view of him was 18-29 year olds. An <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/06/im-andrew-tates-audience-and-i-know-why-he-appeals-to-young-men>article by The Guardian</a> also supports my view that young men find grifters such as Tate to be appealing.</p><p>In short, Democrats failed to reach out to these young men. This increased voter turnout for Trump this year, contributing to his landslide victory.</p><h1 id=voters-simply-didnt-know>Voters simply didn&rsquo;t know<a href=#voters-simply-didnt-know class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>While I don&rsquo;t have specific numbers, I have seen many examples online across various platforms of people voting for Trump and not realizing what it meant. This lack of information could&rsquo;ve been helped by the Democrats leaving the online echo chambers and actually talking to people. So many voters didn&rsquo;t know what they voted for, that Google searches the day of the election spiked asking why Biden wasn&rsquo;t on the ballot. This shows how uninformed the general population is.</p><p>With a voter base so uninformed, we can&rsquo;t be surprised at how many people just voted for the familiar name or for &ldquo;gas prices&rdquo;. They remember that Trump has been president and they didn&rsquo;t know who Harris was or why Biden wasn&rsquo;t running, so of course they voted for him! Why is anyone shocked?</p><h1 id=palestine-gaza-and-israel-isntrael>Palestine, Gaza, and Israel (Isn&rsquo;trael)<a href=#palestine-gaza-and-israel-isntrael class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>Mockingly called Isn&rsquo;trael by many leftists online, the Israel and Palestine issue has been a great center of conflict within the Democratic party. Instead of trying to court leftists by changing course on Palestine, Harris and Biden have repeatedly refused to listen to us. This has lead to many of us refusing to vote for Harris on principal. How could you vote for a genocide? While I admit the fearmongering got to me, and I ashamedly voted for Harris, I believed I was doing a good thing for myself and other queer people. Many others did not fall for this propaganda.</p><p>We must refuse to support a genocidal presidency, with all the blood in our bodies. I sold my soul to vote for Harris and got nothing in return. This was a mistake, and I learned my lesson.</p><p>A large amount of leftists refused to vote for Harris for the same reasons as why I regret doing so - she&rsquo;s a genocidal freak, she has consistently moved further right, and she doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about the working class. I firmly believe the Democrats need a shift in strategy if they want to win, but that brings me to my next point:</p><h1 id=they-dont-want-to-win>They don&rsquo;t want to win<a href=#they-dont-want-to-win class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>Democrats, in their infinite wisdom don&rsquo;t care about winning. Them and the Republicans have the same benefactors: the bourgeoisie. False democracy does not save us from the rich. You know what does? Revolution. Go join the PSL, the SRA, the DSA, and any other organizations you can. Join any organisation movement. We must protest and fight back against the bourgeoisie state. We must go out and make our voices heard, because nobody else will make them heard for us. <strong>This is what must be done to survive.</strong></p><h1 id=so-what-now>So&mldr; What now?<a href=#so-what-now class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>Organize, organize, organize. We must stand strong together or else we will fail. We must find allies and recruit others. Join local organizations. Find a queer or anarchist bookstore. Find every leftist you can, and organize together. Alone, we are weak. Together, we are unstoppable.</p><h1 id=sharing-and-attribution>Sharing and Attribution<a href=#sharing-and-attribution class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>If this is your first time here, you may not be familiar with my copyright model.
