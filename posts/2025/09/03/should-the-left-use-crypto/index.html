Leftist politics. Two things that don&rsquo;t often intermingle. But should they?</p><h1 id=the-start-of-cryptocurrency>The start of cryptocurrency<a href=#the-start-of-cryptocurrency class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>Bitcoin started on 3 January 2009 and was created by someone who used the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. We still don&rsquo;t know who he was, but we can&rsquo;t deny his lasting impact. While Bitcoin certainly has it&rsquo;s flaws, it has lead to the creation of many other cryptocurrencies. It has utility in being the first decentralized way to send and receive money. It is no longer useful to us, since it can be very easily traced by governments and has no other use cases besides investment and transactions that can be public. There are some technologies layered on top, such as Lightning, and some cryptocurrencies based on or such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and a plethora of shitcoins (a word used to describe &lsquo;assets&rsquo; that only exist for speculation), but aside from that, Bitcoin is largely concrete.</p><h1 id=ether-and-the-ethereum-network>Ether, and the Ethereum Network<a href=#ether-and-the-ethereum-network class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>Launching on 30 July 2015, Ethereum ushered in an age of decentralized exchange, atomic swaps, smart contracts, and <em>tokens</em>. Tokens are much like shitcoins — they exist largely for speculation. There are, however, some useful ones, such as Tether, USDC, and other &lsquo;stablecoins&rsquo;. These are useful as a means of sending USD-backed funds internationally and without regulation. They still have a fatal flaw, however, that being the openness of the blockchain.</p><p>As for decentralized exchange and atomic swaps, they are still useful. They&rsquo;re mostly set up on Ethereum or Solana, and are fully automatic. They also can be used centrally on a website or app to automate the exchange of different digital assets. Decentralized exchange though, is a different beast. Using apps like Retoswap or Bisq, you can purchase and trade cryptocurrencies without worrying about KYC (Know Your Customer) or other regulations. This enables the free flow of money without government eyes tracking every single step. If everyone used these, there would no longer be such thing as a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; Bitcoin. You could still trace where it came from, but since nobody knows each other, the government can&rsquo;t trace it to a single person.</p><h1 id=traceability-and-decentralization>Traceability and Decentralization<a href=#traceability-and-decentralization class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>This leaves us with two solutions for privacy, and one is clearly more private than the other. We can either convince everyone to move away from Centralized Exchanges (CEX) to Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), or we can make a cryptocurrency that has true privacy. Enter Monero.</p><p>Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol, as are some others, and was launched in 2014. CryptoNote was launched in 2013. Monero, the Esperanto word for money, is just that: money. It exists to be used. With low transaction fees, an infinite-but-deflationary amount of coins in circulation, and relatively fast (20 minute) transactions, Monero is digital cash. Much like cash, you can store, spend, and receive Monero completely anonymously and without regulation. This has, however, emboldened criminals such as drug dealers to use it. But that&rsquo;s a show of what we can use it for: anything! Drug dealers on the dark web use Monero because it is so anonymous that they&rsquo;re confident nobody can figure out who they are. They can spend and receive it and nobody can see where it came from, where it went, or how much they had. Dealers simply don&rsquo;t get caught with Monero. They get caught by making opsec mistakes. Additionally, there is no such thing as a &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; Monero.</p><h1 id=what-does-that-mean-for-the-left>What does that mean for the Left?<a href=#what-does-that-mean-for-the-left class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><p>This means that Monero is a way for leftists to collaborate on funding, help each other, and share resources, all without facing regulatory scrutiny, know-your-customer requirements, and while maintaining privacy. Monero also has extraordinarily low fees, meaning that if leftists use it for donations, we keep more of the money. Cards take 2-4% fees typically, which is significant in high volume. That&rsquo;s what got Visa to be one of the most valuable technology companies.</p><p>If the Left adopts Monero, it will also allow us to hide better from the government when we don&rsquo;t want them seeing what we&rsquo;re up to. Be it DIY hormones, drug test kits for community aid, or funding for protest materials, it helps with one goal: <strong>We Keep Us Safe</strong>. If we keep us safe, we can keep us safer with the aid of privacy-preserving currency.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/posts/2025/06/22/on-israel/ class="button inline next">[<span class=button__text>On Israel</span>] ></a></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>© 2025 KatieTheDev</span>
