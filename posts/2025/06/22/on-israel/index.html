There’s something about Israel that makes people uncomfortable, and it’s not what they say it is.

I, as most sane people would, believe that it is immoral to bomb a foreign country unprovoked. I commented this. Here&rsquo;s a reply I got, broken down at paragraph breaks for my response.</p><blockquote><p>There’s something about Israel that makes people uncomfortable, and it’s not what they say it is.</p></blockquote><p>Why I am uncomfortable with Israel is exactly why I say I am: Israel is a settler-colonial state hellbent on the genocide of Muslims. They&rsquo;re also a Jewish ethnostate. I do not believe any ethnostate should exist, even for a global minority.</p><blockquote><p>They’ll point to politics, settlements, borders, and wars.<br>But scratch beneath the outrage, and you’ll find something deeper. A discomfort not with what Israel does, but with what Israel is.<br>A nation this small should not be this strong. Period.</p></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it is deeper than politics, settlement, and wars, for some people, I believe that those issues alone are enough for any rational human to see why Israel is problematic. As for the claim about a nation so small being too strong, I agree. It is too powerful for how small it is. But what you left out is <em>why</em> Israel is so powerful. Israel is so powerful because the existence of Israel is backed by the USA. Biden said so himself, as a senator, when he said that if Israel didn&rsquo;t exist, the USA would have to make a new one.</p><blockquote><p>Israel has no oil.<br>No special natural resources.<br>A population barely the size of a mid-sized American city.<br>They are surrounded by enemies.<br>Hated in the United Nations.<br>Targeted by terror. Condemned by celebrities.<br>Boycotted, slandered, and attacked.
And still, they thrive like there’s no tomorrow.<br>In military.<br>In medicine.<br>In security.
In technology.<br>In agriculture.<br>In intelligence.<br>In morality.<br>In sheer, unbreakable will.</p></blockquote><p>This didn&rsquo;t render correctly on Reddit, as apparently, the commenter doesn&rsquo;t understand Markdown formatting. While this is a sign of them being a bot or troll, we&rsquo;ll ignore this for now.</p><p>Indeed, Israel has no oil or natural resources. What Israel does have, however, is the backing of the country with the largest military budget in the world. Israel also has sites that are seen as holy by the world&rsquo;s two largest religions, and all three Abrahamic religions.</p><p>Now, the user mentions how Israel &ldquo;thrives&rdquo; in fields such as military, medicine, &ldquo;security&rdquo; (definition needed), technology, agriculture, intelligence, morality (citation needed), and whatever &ldquo;sheer, unbreakable will&rdquo; is supposed to be. Let&rsquo;s break this down into a few sections.</p><p>First, the claim of Israel thriving in military areas is true. Israel <em>does</em> have an oversized military budget and too much military technology. This is because <a href=https://www.cgaa.org/article/how-much-money-has-us-given-israel-since-october-7>the United States has given Israel more than $14 Billion in military aid</a>(<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250324201455/https://www.cgaa.org/article/how-much-money-has-us-given-israel-since-october-7>archive.org</a>) in the period between the attacks on 7 October 2022 and the date the source article was published, on 17 February 2025. According to <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-defense?fy=2025">usaspending.gov</a>, the US has a military budget of over $878.5 Billion. Much bigger than what we&rsquo;ve given to Israel, yes, but much of that money was simply given to contractors for R&amp;D and production. What we give Israel has a far greater value than the paper value of $14 Billion. Additionally, the US provided Israel with the Iron Dome system that the commenter mentions further down in their comment.</p><p>When it comes to medicine, it is also true that Israel has advanced medicine. They also have universal healthcare, partially paid for by US aid. Yes, the US really does pay for a foreign country to have universal healthcare before even moving an inch on healthcare domestically. Most of Israel&rsquo;s medical care is because of US and global research. Israel doesn&rsquo;t contain the world&rsquo;s most premier medical schools. The US and Europe do. Israel is borrowing talent developed in other nations. I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re able to have access, but so should everyone else. Medicine should not be gatekept.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to skip over security, because again, I&rsquo;m completely not sure what the commenter is talking about.</p><p>For technology, Israel is the location of an Intel chip fab as well as for a handful of other companies. Here&rsquo;s the kicker: the designs are produced in other countries, primarily by engineers in the US. Israel happens to be a good place for silica, to be used in production of silicon chips. Silica is in sand. They built a chip fab near sand. That&rsquo;s a smart business move. They could&rsquo;ve done it in the US or any other country if they thought it would be more profitable. What technology has Israel developed independently?</p><p>I will concede that <a href=https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-agricultural-innovations-will-keep-the-world-fed/>Israel has made agricultural advancements</a>(<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250612083744/https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-agricultural-innovations-will-keep-the-world-fed/>archive.org</a>) on their own, and reading through the article provided great insight into how they farm there. Good on them, we need more agricultural technology.</p><p>But intelligence? Israel relies on the US for intelligence much the same as Ukraine was. If the US didn&rsquo;t provide Israel with intelligence about threats, they might not be in the same situation they&rsquo;re in now.</p><p>Lastly, in morality, I do not believe Israel can claim moral superiority over any other country. Their soldiers murder, beat, and rape Muslims. They engage in genocide and war crimes. They have used white phosphorus in Gaza, and they have bombed hospitals. None of these actions are moral or forgivable.</p><p>While they also claim Israel to be a leader in &ldquo;sheer, unbreakable will&rdquo;, I will not argue against or substantiate such a claim. It is not quantifiable and is a matter of pure opinion. Morality is too, but I can at least provide a solid argument that most people will understand. Will is purely philosophical.</p><blockquote><p>They turn desert into farmland.<br>They make water from air.<br>They intercept rockets in mid-air.<br>They rescue hostages under the nose of the world’s worst regimes.<br>They survive wars that were supposed to wipe them out, and win.</p></blockquote><p>As I&rsquo;ve addressed the agricultural technology Israel has developed, I&rsquo;ll skip over that section here.</p><p>As for intercepting rockets, that is the Iron Dome program I mentioned previously. The Iron Dome was a testbed for the Patriot anti-missile defense systems the US developed. The Iron Dome, while functional, does let some rockets through. I will commend the great amount of technological knowledge it takes to develop such a system, but it is not their own, and it is being used to defend a genocidal regime.</p><p>I do not recall any stories about Israel rescuing any hostages. If any readers can find a source, I&rsquo;d be happy to discuss it here.</p><p>As for surviving and winning wars that were &ldquo;supposed to wipe them out&rdquo;, Israel has had an insane amount of help from the US and from other western nations, as I mentioned when going over military aid. Additionally, the countries they have been at war with are often using old Soviet technology that doesn&rsquo;t stand up against modern US military equipment that has been supplied to Israel.</p><blockquote><p>The world watches this and can’t make sense of it.</p></blockquote><p>I just made sense of it. The commenter is very pretentious.</p><blockquote><p>So they do what people do when they witness strength they can’t understand.</p><p>They assume it must be cheating.<br>It must be American aid.<br>It must be foreign lobbying.<br>It must be oppression.<br>It must be theft.<br>It must be some dark trick that gave the Jews this kind of power.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not cheating. Receiving aid and paying off US politicians (AIPAC) is legal. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but it&rsquo;s legal. Israel is a testbed for new American war strategy, technology, and influence. In return for allowing the US to test things there, Israel has received a massive amount of defensive and offensive aid. Israel also lobbies (read: bribes) US politicians to keep the deal alive. It&rsquo;s a very mutualistic relationship.</p><p>No, it&rsquo;s not theft, or a &ldquo;dark trick&rdquo;. Saying it is would be antisemitic. Israel, nor Jews, have any special powers, nor do they come about their prosperity and wealth through illegal means.</p><p>Oppression, though, is very real. Israel oppresses Muslims in Gaza. Israel doesn&rsquo;t have legalized gay marriage. Israel uses racial and national profiling in their airports. If you&rsquo;re brown and you fly through Ben Gurian, you&rsquo;re most likely getting &ldquo;randomly selected&rdquo; for the strictest screening. Only Israeli citizens are allowed to pass through their airport relatively unencumbered. Even US citizens are likely to get selected for some form of secondary screening.</p><blockquote><p>It must be blackmail.<br>Because heaven forbid it’s something else.<br>Heaven forbid it’s real.<br>Heaven forbid it’s earned.</p></blockquote><p>Nope. Didn&rsquo;t argue it&rsquo;s blackmail. The only people I&rsquo;ve seen say that are neo-Nazis, trolls, and the occasional leftist who is joking around. Now, I must preface the next section with a warning: it is about to get <em>weird</em>. This commenter seemingly believes that Israel got into their current position not through cooperation with western colonial powers, but instead through magic. You know, the same magic they just shat on. Instead of calling it a &ldquo;dark power&rdquo; they call it &ldquo;divine&rdquo;. Same idea, different coat.</p><blockquote><p>Or worse, destined.</p><p>The Jewish people were supposed to disappear a long, long time ago.<br>That’s how the story of exiled, enslaved, hated minorities is supposed to end.<br>But the Jews didn’t disappear.<br>They actually came home, rebuilt their land, revived their language, and brought their dead back to life — in memory, in identity, and in strength.<br>That’s not normal.<br>It’s not political.<br>It’s biblical.</p></blockquote><p>No, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to actually wipe out an entire group. It has happened plenty of times, but usually just enough people survive for those ideas to persevere. Naziism and fascism are on the rise, despite European denazification. This is because the ideology wasn&rsquo;t stamped out. It continued in the US. It continued behind the scenes in western Europe.</p><p>Also, has anyone told the commenter why the Jews went back to Israel? It&rsquo;s because Europe was still incredibly racist after WWII and wanted to dump them somewhere. Israel was the location they picked, because it was full of brown people who couldn&rsquo;t fight back and who were even more hated than Jews.</p><p>Also, I must point out the usage of the em dash — can you tell me exactly what key is used to type that? I typed one on my phone, but most people don&rsquo;t know how and will simply use a hyphen. Em dashes often come from ChatGPT and other large language models. Not definitive this user is a bot, but that&rsquo;s two red flags now.</p><blockquote><p>There’s no cheat code that explains how a group of people return to their homeland after 2,000 years.</p><p>There is no rational path from gas chambers to global influence.</p></blockquote><p>There isn&rsquo;t? Israel realized the US would be sympathetic if they could serve as a regional mouthpiece. It was a strategic decision. The US developed Israel as it&rsquo;s main power core of the Middle East.</p><blockquote><p>And there is no historical precedent for surviving; the Babylonians, the Romans, the Crusaders, the Inquisition, the pogroms, and the Holocaust, and still showing up to work on Monday in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.</p><p>Israel doesn’t make sense.</p><p>Unless you believe in something beyond the math.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not about math. Humans aren&rsquo;t rational. Humans are stubborn. Humans persevere through hard times. Gay people survived all kinds of bullshit too. Transgender people survived the concentration camps and still exist. Communists are still around in the US despite the death of the USSR. Black people survived slavery and colonialism. This is not the first, last, or most extreme example of human life persisting through peril. The intervention of a divine entity is not required for this. There is no chosen people.</p><blockquote><p>This is what drives the world crazy.<br>Because if Israel is real, if this improbable, ancient, hated nation is somehow still chosen, protected, and thriving, then maybe God isn’t a myth after all.</p></blockquote><p>The Israel of today is not the Israel of the Bible or Talmud. That Israel ended centuries ago. The new Israel was formed in the aftermath of WWII.</p><blockquote><p>Maybe He’s still in the story.<br>Maybe history isn’t random.<br>Maybe evil doesn’t get the last word.<br>Maybe the Jews are not just a people… but a testimony.<br>That’s what they can’t stand.<br>Because once you admit that Israel’s survival isn’t just impressive, but divine, everything changes.</p></blockquote><p>As I have mentioned, this is not even the same Israel despite the name. Also, <em>you can be a Christian and not be a Zionist.</em> <em><strong>You can be a Jew and not be a Zionist.</strong></em> I&rsquo;ve met both. I&rsquo;ve known both. I&rsquo;ve loved (platonically) both. In fact, I&rsquo;m currently on a strange path of religion that I feel deserves it&rsquo;s own blog post, but I am currently leaning into Christianity, and specifically, I have been going to an Episcopalian church.</p><blockquote><p>Your moral compass has to reset.
Your assumptions about history, power, and justice collapse. You realize you’re not watching the end of an empire.
You’re witnessing the beginning of something eternal.</p><p>So they deny it.
They smear it.
And rage against it.
Because it’s easier to call a miracle “cheating” than to face the possibility that God keeps His promises.</p><p>And He’s keeping them still.</p></blockquote><p>I do not smear Israel. I do not rage against Israel. I do not accuse Israel of cheating. I do not deny God, and I do not deny that He has promises. Rather, I deny the premise that God would protect and choose a nation that is currently engaged in genocide and terrorism. I deny that a country should be an ethnostate. I deny that Israel was founded on any principles of freedom. I acknowledge that Israel was founded as an ethnostate. I acknowledge that Israel engages in genocide, war crimes, and atrocities. I acknowledge that Israel was founded as a way to segregate Jews from Europe, and in turn, to remove Muslims from a land they lived in and found holy. I acknowledge that because of the fundamentally flawed premises behind the creation and continuation of Israel, that Israel needs to either cease existing as a state, or it must completely reform itself in the name of true equality.</p><p>Nothing I have laid out here is contradictory. The commenter, however, is. They believe that Israel is the most moral country. That contradicts with reality. Israel is a country founded on pain and suffering. Israel is not the Israel of the Bible. The Israel of the Bible does not exist currently as a literal country.</p><hr><p>If you have made it this far, thank you.
